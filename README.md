
##### Getting Started

 [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


##### What is Yeoman?

 
 Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)


 Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.


 Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*


 $ `npm install -g yo`
